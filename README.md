Modelling fission–fusion dynamics to support paper publication https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00265-022-03235-0

We share the scripts prepared by Claudia Faustino and Fabio Matos (flopesdematos) to support the work lead by Joana Castro which looked at Common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) fission–fusion dynamics in the south coast of Portugal.

The work is divided in 3 objectives. You'll find a script for each:

Objective 1) Modelling party size

Objective 2) Modelling behavioral state

Objective 3) Modelling Fission-fusion dynamics

.


We hope the script are useful - have fun!
